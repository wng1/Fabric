Designing reports is just more than just connecting to data.
Understanding semantic models and strategies for scalability and optimization are key to a successful enterprise implementation.
Data Modelling, best practices
Power BI Premium (working with large data)
40GB dataset, 80GB memory available, 100GB memory
---------------------
Use DirectQuery when data sources store large volume of data and/or reports needs to deliver real-time data.
Use Composite Model if you need to:
1) Boost query performance of a DirectQuery model
2) Deliver near real-time query results from an import model
3) Extend a Power BI dataset (or Azure Analysis Service model) with other data
---------------------
Best practices
1) Start with import mode
2) Only bring data you need
3) Avoid wide tables
4) Use a star schema in Power BI
5) Reduce the usage of calculated columns
6) Avoid high cardinality columns
7) USe appropriate types
8) Limit the use of bi-directional filters on relationships
9) Disable auto date/time
10) Disable attribute hierarchies for non-attribute columns
11) If querying relationship database, query database views rather the tables
12) Views should not contain logic. only SLECT statement from ta table
13) Consider partitioning and incremental refresh to avoid loading data you don't need to
14) Query Folding
